    "# PID Controller\n",
    "---\n",
    "This project is an implementation of PID controller to control a self driving car around track in simulator. The simulator feed the system with the cross track error `cte` to compute steering angle along the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PID \n",
    "PID is a closed loop feedback controller that calculate the output signal based on the difference between current state of the object and desired state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* P(proportional): the steering angle value is calculated proportional to the cross track error(cte) that represent the offset between the car and center of the lane. By using P controller only the vehicle will overshoot to the desired point.\n",
    "* D(integral): to avoid overshooting and decrease output steering angle the derivative term repose is proportional to the rate of change of the `cte` which will increase the controller responds. However by using PD controller the vehicle wiggles along the track that might caused by the vehicle drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I(derivative): integral component added in order to compensate the vehicle drift as it handle any small error to increase slowly by summing the error over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Tuning\n",
    "I tuned the PID controller by setting D &I terms to zero and start to tune P until I found the car drive itself to 15% of the track with high osculation. then I added term D and I increased to 4 and the car can finish the track on 28m/s speed with wiggling behavior. After adding I term with small value gain the car could accomplish the track successfully as following.\n",
